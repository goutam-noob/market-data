I want to get the End Of the Day Options Data for NIFTY ; OI, change in OI, IV, then store it somewhere.
then I want to compare with previous EOD OI data and 
  1. find out which strike has highest CE/PE data and also mention the number of contracts there (found in OI column).
  2. find which strike had the highest change in CE/PE OI today and also find both change value & pct.
  3. maybe plot ATM(at the money;strike closest to underlying) IV. {not imp}
  4. calculate ATM PCR(put call ratio)= PE OI ATM/ CE OI ATM. {not imp}
  5. 

some websites which are already doing it,
